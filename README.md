# Data-professional-survey-breakdown---Power-BI-project
This Power BI project analyzes and visualizes the results of a survey conducted among data professionals. The project aims to understand key aspects of the data profession, including demographics, educational backgrounds, job roles, skills, tools, salaries, and work environments.
**Dataset Overview**
The dataset typically contains responses from thousands of data professionals, covering variables like:

Demographics: Age, gender, country, region

Education: Degrees held, field of study

Employment: Current role (e.g., Data Scientist, Analyst, Engineer), years of experience

Skills: Tools and technologies used (e.g., Python, R, SQL, Power BI, Tableau)

Salaries: Salary ranges segmented by region, experience, and role

Work Environment: Remote/hybrid/on-site, team size, satisfaction

**Power BI Structure**
The report leverages Power BIâ€™s core features:

Data Modeling: Cleaning and transforming survey data using Power Query (ETL) to remove missing or inconsistent data and establish relationships between tables (e.g., linking roles to salaries).

Visualizations: Dynamic dashboards with slicers to filter by region, role, experience, etc. Key visuals include:

Bar and column charts to compare salary ranges across roles and regions

Maps for global distribution of respondents

Donut/pie charts for skills usage

Stacked bar charts showing role distribution by gender or experience

Interactive Features: Tooltips, bookmarks, drill-through pages for detailed exploration (e.g., diving into role-specific salary trends).

**Analysis Highlights**

Salary disparities by region and gender

Popular tools and programming languages

Skill gaps and learning trends among professionals
